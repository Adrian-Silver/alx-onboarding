# To develop an algorithm that calculates a running sum


# A user will enter numbers that will be added to the sum and when a negative 
#number is encountered, stop adding numbers and write out the final result


# Enter the first number
# Let the sum start as 0
# IF the num is >= 0,
    # Add num to sum
     # Enter another number
# Else print sum


input int num
int sum
sum = 0
if num>= 0 Then
     sum = sum + num
     input num
Else
     print sum
